# Url shortener

## Requirements

    Install mongodb

##TODO

* Mumur gem is created a uniq hash so we could have the same link for 2 users, so we should add a distinction between this link

* Murmur gem is creating an integer, a string would be better

* Show the link right after the button “shorten the url”

* Gemify the project so you can install it on a Web server

* Beautify raising errors

* Tests the controller UrlShorteners and User model
